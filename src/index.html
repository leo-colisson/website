        I'm a PhD student in <em>quantum cryptography</em> at the LIP6 laboratory (Laboratoire d'Informatique Paris 6) of Sorbonne Université (France). I'm supervised by Prof. Elham Kashefi and Prof. Antoine Joux.
      </p>
      <h2>Expertise</h2>
      <p>
        I'm working mostly on the design and the security analysis of protocols related to <em>delegated blind quantum computing</em>, assuming a <em>purely classical client</em>. I use notably <em>lattice based cryptography</em> and <em>composable security</em>.
      </p>
      <h2>Curriculum</h2>
      <p>
        After two years of highly intensive competitive exam preparation, I had the chance to enter the <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_normale_sup%C3%A9rieure_Paris-Saclay">Ecole Normale Supérieure (ENS) Paris-Saclay</a></em>, itself part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris-Saclay_University">Université Paris-Saclay</a>. After completing a first Bachelor in physics, I obtained a second Bachelor and a Master in computer science (<a href="https://wikimpri.dptinfo.ens-cachan.fr/doku.php">MPRI</a>).

          <p>
            I worked mostly on the design and security proof of <em>QFactory</em>, a protocol that can be used to prepare a quantum state on a server in such a way that the purely classical client knows the description of that state while this state is unknown to the server.
          </p>
          <p>
            This primitive is a fundamental building block in many protocols, allowing for example blind delegated quantum computation. The construction of QFactory involves careful design of cryptographic functions based on the Learning With Errors (LWE) problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also showed impossibility results regarding composable security of classical-client Remote State Preparation protocols and classical-client Universal Blind Quantum Computing protocols.

            I have been a teaching assistant in:
            <ul>
              <li>Python (L2)</li>
              <li>Cryptography (L3)</li>
              <li>Discrete Mathematics (L2)</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also tutoring a student since 2017 (he is in 2020 starting his first year at the university) to prepare him for some very important and competitive national exams in Israel. I taught him notably:
            <ul>
              <li>Programming, including Functional and Object-Oriented Programming (Python/Django, Javascript, C, Ocaml…)</li>
              <li>Assembly: creation of a compiler in Ocaml to compile a "C--" language into 64 bits assembly</li>
              <li>System Architecture: he started to create a basic OS from scratch, booting in real 16 bits mode</li>
              <li>AI: he is now starting a project on opinion mining, that should involve Machine Learning, SVM…</li>
            </ul>

          <p>
            I am a fan of Salsa since I discovered it in 2012. I was the head of a Salsa association in 2015−2016, and for two years I co-created Salsa choreography shows. I also like music in general: I played the Piano for 9 years, and I started to learn the Saxophone in 2018.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also really like programming in my free time, and I enjoy exploring this wonderful world. Of course, I'm a strong supporter of the open source community <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(NixOs <span uk-icon="icon: heart"></span>)</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally, I like Nature. Hiking, biking, photography, travelling (locally if possible: too bad plane is not carbon-friendly…), and, without forgetting my first love: astronomy!
          </p>
          <p>
            Hopefully, I'll soon be able to talk about all of that (and more) in my blog!
