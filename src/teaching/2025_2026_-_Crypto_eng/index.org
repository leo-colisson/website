** TP

While I do not really do TP, I sometimes interleave during the CM/TD some exercise in the page course in [[https://moodle.caseine.org/course/view.php?id=1342][Caseine]], for instance by allowing you to actually code the adversaries of the exercise in python, or to order the elements of a proof to familiarize with the framework.
