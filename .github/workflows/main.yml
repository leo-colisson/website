# the website on the "gh-pages" branch which will host the website.
# To enable it, make sure to configure it in the project: "Settings > Pages".
# The website is served by default at https://leo-colisson.github.io/website/
# but we can configure a custom domain (just add "CNAME leo-colisson.github.io.").
# It is even possible to configure https!
# TODO: enable caching. See e.g. https://github.com/actions/cache.
